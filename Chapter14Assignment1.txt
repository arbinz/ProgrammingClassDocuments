big o notation is used in computer science. when it is used, it quantifies values 
such as amount of data. the more data used, the slower the process. Big o is
satisfied when the value of both sides of the equal sign are functionally the
same. definition of big o: f(n)=O(g(n)) if there exist constants N and C such that
|f(n)| <C|g(n)| for all n>N.
